 <h2>:bulb: About</h2>

<strong>Hangman</strong> is a word-guessing game where one person thinks of a word and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters. 
Correct guesses reveal the letters in the word, while incorrect guesses lead to the drawing of a hangman figure. 
The game continues until the word is guessed or the hangman figure is completed.
